# Citizen Database

### Description
This project was created with the idea of being in a dystopian cyberpunk universe where citizen information is easily accessed using an api. Things like birth date, ssn, bank balance, and social credit can be queried from the database.
- The frontend that uses this project can be found here: [Front End](https://github.com/chrisseals98/Delta)

### Technologies Used
This project uses Express for an API and Sequelize as the ORM for data querying. Swagger is also used for some API documentation*, but more documentation needs to be added!*

### Setup
- `npm install`
- [Create a mock database](#creating-a-mock-database)

### Run

### Creating A Mock Database

- Run the SQL script on a SqliteDB

### Endpoints
